# Democratic Sanctions and Human Rights Improvement Study

Welcome to the repository for the research study titled **"Democratic Sanctions and the Improvement of Human Rights"** by Daryoosh Dehestani. This study investigates the impact of democratic sanctions on human rights improvement in target states, emphasizing the effectiveness and moral dimension of such sanctions.

## Overview

Concerns have been raised about the potential of sanctions leading to increased repression. This research, however, specifically analyzes the effects of democratic sanctions. The study draws inspiration from two influential sources: Neumayer (2005) and Pospieszna and Weber (2020), which serve as foundational studies for the analysis.

In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the imposition of sanctions with the objective of advancing human rights and democracy (Felbermayr et al., 2021). Termed as democratic sanctions in this paper, their purpose is to foster democratic governance and promote human rights.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

1. **Examine Effectiveness:** Investigate whether democratic sanctions can effectively contribute to the improvement of human rights in target states.
2. **Moral Dimension:** Address the moral justification for the implementation of democratic sanctions, challenging the widespread criticism associated with sanctions.

## Key Findings

The findings of this study demonstrate:

- Democratic sanctions can contribute to improvements in human rights performance in target states.
- Policymakers are provided with empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness and moral grounding of democratic sanctions.
- There is hope for individuals living under autocratic regimes, suggesting that the imposition of democratic sanctions can potentially pave the way for enhanced human rights conditions.
